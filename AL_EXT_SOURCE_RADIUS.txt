AL_EXT_SOURCE_RADIUS

This extension allows any mono source to be changed to be a "large" source with a radius.
The source has a raised cosine shape.

The AL_SOURCE_RADIUS tag can be used with alSourcef() to set the source radius. Units are consistent with the coordinate system in use. The value must be at least zero. Use a value of zero to reset to a point source.
