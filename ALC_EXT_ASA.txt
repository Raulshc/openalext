***** ALC_EXT_ASA
The ASA (Apple Spatial Audio) extension currently provides three main effects: reverb, occlusion and obstruction.

  Reverb:   A reverb effect with multiple presets and quality settings. Post EQ settings available for additional tonal control.

  Occlusion:  An effect that applies a low pass filter to an OpenAL source object for simulating objects 
      in different 'spaces' from the listener (post EQ, causing send to reverb to also be filtered)

  Obstruction:  An effect that applies a low pass filter to an OpenAL source object for simulating objects being 'obstructed' 
      from the listener (pre-EQ, allowing high frequencies of source object to remain in the reverb)
