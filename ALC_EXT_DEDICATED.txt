ALC_EXT_DEDICATED

This extension provides two "routing" EFX effects that allow sounds to be sent to dedicated speaker channels.
Audio rendered to the dedicated low frequency effect (AL_EFFECT_DEDICATED_LOW_FREQUENCY_EFFECT) is routed to a subwoofer if one is present. Otherwise, it is discarded.

Audio rendered to the dedicated dialogue effect (AL_EFFECT_DEDICATED_DIALOGUE) is routed to a front centre speaker if one is present. Otherwise, it is rendered to the front centre using the normal spatialisation logic.

Both effects support a gain control parameter AL_DEDICATED_GAIN, which defaults to 1.

Tokens:

AL_DEDICATED_GAIN (0x1)
AL_EFFECT_DEDICATED_DIALOGUE (0x9001)
AL_EFFECT_DEDICATED_LOW_FREQUENCY_EFFECT (0x9000)
