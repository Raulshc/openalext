AL_EXT_STEREO_ANGLES

This extension allows any stereo source to be "steered" by setting the angles at which the left and right channels should play.
Angles are always specified in radians, anticlockwise relative to the real front (AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE is not supported).

The AL_STEREO_ANGLES tag can be used with alSourcefv() and two angles. The angles are specified anticlockwise relative to the real front, so a normal 60degree front stage is specified with alSourcefv(sid,AL_STEREO_ANGLES,+M_PI/6,-M_PI/6).
