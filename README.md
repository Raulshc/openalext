OpenAL extension repository
===========================

Since there was no universal (and up to date) repository of OpenAL extensions, I've decided
to compile information available from different sources. As for now, a lot of these descriptions
are only stubs or extracts from headers.

If you have more detailed description of a specific OpenAL extension (or would like to provide
list of extensions available on a specific platform), please issue a pull request.
